Legendary Sentinel of Attendance is a computer vision-based attendance system developed using EmguCV, C#, and .NET Windows Forms Application (WFA). It automates the attendance tracking process by utilizing facial recognition technology.

## Features

- **Facial Recognition**: Identify and recognize faces to track attendance accurately.
- **Database Integration**: Store attendance records securely in a database for future reference and analysis.
- **User Interface**: Intuitive Windows Forms interface for easy interaction and management.
- **Real-time Updates**: Receive instant updates on attendance status during the session.
- **Customization**: Configure settings and parameters to adapt the system to different environments and requirements.

## Technologies Used

- **EmguCV**: Open-source computer vision library for .NET applications.
- **C#**: Primary programming language for application development.
- **.NET Framework**: Development framework for building Windows applications.
- **SQL Database**: Integration with a relational database for data storage.
- **Git**: Version control system for collaborative development and code management.
